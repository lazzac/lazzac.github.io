    <h1> Welcome</h1>
    <p> Hello, welcome to my new website. If you made it here it means
        you know the secret password, congratulations! To reward you, here
        are some things that ive been thinking about. These are the words I want
        to say to you, but I dont have the heart to say it to you on discord, so you
        can just read it off this site instead. lol.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Btw none of the thingies work, just this page so dont go looking
        arround
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're seeing this, it means that its probably your birthday.
        <br>
        Happy Birthday! You're so old now! 19 years old.. wow. You've made it
        so far in life and have been through so much. I'm so proud of you and 
        I cant wait to see where you go in the future. Thank you for all the 
        good times you've given me, the time we spent together was truly
        the best time of my life and the memories will never leave me. I miss 
        you so much and I wish we could have had more time with each other. 
        I'll never forget all the times we had, all the crappy times and all 
        the good times, I learnt alot from our relationship. All I ever did
        was try to make you happy and I think I achieved that.
        I'm happy knowing that I gave you my entire world and the 
        happy smiles you'd give when we were together are something I 
        won't ever forget. Theres a million other things I could say, but I think
        you get the point so I'll leave it at this. 
        I was going to give you a card, but instead you can have this little 
        internet capsule. Something that will never go away (unless i shut down
        the website haha).

        As I write this on the 24th of January 2022, I sit and reflect on 
        my own life, its been exactly two weeks since you left and I feel as 
        if it was a lifetime ago. A lifetime ago that we broke up, and a
        lifetime ago since I felt the agonising pain that broke my heart into
        a million pieces. Since then, I'm slowly starting to pick up
        the pieces again. I know what I must do to be happy, but most days I
        just feel alone.
        I'm trying to fill the void you left, whilst you've
        already filled it with work and school and those dudes on bumble you've
        been hunting for. "Looking for someone who doesnt wanna rush".
    </p>
    <p> Im gonna be honest, when I read that, my heart sank, I thought
        "Wow i cant believe she's already looking for someone else,
        after all that shit she told me about focusing on herself and 
        her career". But as I sat there at 5am, unable to sleep thinking
        about why you would already be looking for someone else, I came to
        a realisation. But that realisation, I won't say on this site. 
        All I'll say is Good Luck.
    </p>
    <p> These past two weeks, I've been pondering whether to buy you
        a birthday present, a nice silver bracelet with sapphires on it.
        But after what I saw on bumble, I decided no. Why would I spend
        so much money on someone who's already looking for someone else?
        It was a slap in the face that I needed. So thank you for helping
        me save my money.
    </p>
    <p> Anyways, I have a million things to say, but my words can't express
        all of them. I have no hard feelings toward you Bic. I don't hate you, and I do 
        plan to see you in the near future.
        The more I think about the things you've done, the more I can 
        sympathise with you.
        I hope we can meet again in the future on
        better terms. You're a wonderful woman and I hope our paths can cross again.
        I know this read has been very disjointed and there are alot
        of ups and downs, but this is just straight from the heart how I feel, so sorry about that.
    </p>
    <P>

        so I think it'll be a good time to catch up whenever
        it does happen and ill bring food.
        If you promise to lmk when I can come over, I promise I wont be ugly.
